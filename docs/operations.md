# Operations

How to run incuse day-to-day on the host.

## Logs

incuse logs JSON to stderr; systemd captures it.

```sh
# Live tail.
journalctl -u incuse -f

# Last 200 lines, pretty-printed.
journalctl -u incuse -n 200 -o cat | jq -c .

# Filter by runner name.
journalctl -u incuse -o cat |
  jq -c 'select(.runner_name == "incuse-2vcpu-4gb-20gb-amd64-aaaa")'
```

Useful structured fields incuse sets when relevant: `runner_name`,
`scale_set`, `scale_set_id`, `vcpu`, `mem_mb`, `disk_gb`, `arch`, `error`,
and `reason`.

## Inspecting in-flight runners

The orchestrator's view, indirectly via Incus:

```sh
incus list --project incuse
```

Anything tagged `user.incuse.managed=true` is ours:

```sh
incus list --project incuse \
  -c name,status,config:user.incuse.runner_name,config:user.incuse.job_id,config:user.incuse.minted_at \
  -f csv
```

If you see an instance whose `minted_at` is older than `runner.registration_timeout` (default 10m) and the orchestrator hasn't reaped it, either the reaper is not running (check `journalctl -u incuse`) or the orchestrator process has lost track of it (drift sweep should catch it on the next 30s tick).

## Reaping orphans manually

If incuse is down and you want to clean up before restart:

```sh
incus list --project incuse -c name,config:user.incuse.managed -f csv \
  | awk -F, '$2 == "true" {print $1}' \
  | xargs -r -I{} incus delete --force --project incuse {}
```

Once incuse is back up, the drift sweep picks up anything you missed within 30s.

## Reading the scale set on GitHub

Every runner registration shows up under `Settings → Actions → Runners → <scale set name>` on the org. Idle entries with no matching VM in `incus list` are GitHub-side stragglers — they expire on their own (default ~14 days), but `gh api` works to clear them out:

```sh
gh api -X GET "/orgs/netwerk-io/actions/runners?per_page=100" \
  | jq -r '.runners[] | select(.status=="offline") | .id' \
  | xargs -r -I{} gh api -X DELETE "/orgs/netwerk-io/actions/runners/{}"
```

## Rotating the GitHub PAT

```sh
sudo install -m 0600 -o incuse -g incuse /dev/stdin /etc/incuse/github.pat <<<"ghp_new..."
sudo systemctl restart incuse
```

Validate before restart if you'd rather catch a bad token without dropping in-flight jobs:

```sh
sudo -u incuse /usr/local/bin/incuse --validate --config /etc/incuse/config.yaml
```

## Changing config

The orchestrator currently reloads on restart only — there is no SIGHUP handler. For changes:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart incuse
```

In-flight runners (Incus VMs that have already started) are unaffected; the reaper picks them up on the next sweep after restart via the drift-sweep path.

## Draining

`systemctl stop incuse` cancels the orchestrator's context, which:

- stops every scale-set listener and cancels owned mint/launch tasks,
- returns the reaper goroutine,
- closes the scaleset session.

In-flight VMs keep running their jobs and self-poweroff via the cloud-init `ExecStopPost=/sbin/poweroff` path. Their Incus instance entries linger until the next time incuse runs (drift sweep). This is fine; it just means restart picks them up.

If you need a faster drain:

```sh
incus list --project incuse -c name,config:user.incuse.managed -f csv \
  | awk -F, '$2 == "true" {print $1}' \
  | xargs -r -I{} incus delete --force --project incuse {}
```

## Upgrades

```sh
TAG=v0.2.0
ARCH=linux-amd64
cd /tmp/incuse-install
curl -fsSLO "https://github.com/netwerk-io/incuse/releases/download/${TAG}/incuse-${TAG}-${ARCH}.tar.gz"
curl -fsSLO "https://github.com/netwerk-io/incuse/releases/download/${TAG}/SHA256SUMS"
sha256sum --ignore-missing -c SHA256SUMS
tar -xzf "incuse-${TAG}-${ARCH}.tar.gz"
sudo install -m 0755 "incuse-${TAG}-${ARCH}/incuse" /usr/local/bin/incuse
sudo systemctl restart incuse
```

The on-disk config and unit are unchanged across patch releases. Check the release notes for any minor-bump migration steps before upgrading.

## Health checks

With `observability.listen_addr` set in config:

```sh
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:9090/healthz   # 200 once scaleset bootstrap succeeded
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:9090/readyz    # 200 once orchestrator.Run started
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:9090/metrics   # Prometheus exposition
```

`/healthz` and `/readyz` are intentionally separate — the former flips on after the scale-set is registered with GitHub, the latter once the orchestrator's main loop is actually running. A load balancer in front of multiple incuse hosts (future) can tell "alive" from "taking traffic".

### Prometheus scrape config

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: incuse
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["incuse-host.example.com:9090"]
```

### Useful metrics

All metrics live under the `incuse_` prefix. The high-signal ones:

| metric | type | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `incuse_jobs_assigned_total` | counter | Jobs the orchestrator accepted (post spec resolution) |
| `incuse_launches_total{result}` | counter | Incus launch outcomes (`ok` / `fail`) |
| `incuse_launch_duration_seconds` | histogram | Wall-clock cost of one Incus launch |
| `incuse_runner_lifetime_seconds` | histogram | JobAssigned → terminate, end-to-end |
| `incuse_reaps_total{reason}` | counter | `registration_timeout` / `max_job_duration` / `drift_sweep` / `job_completed` |
| `incuse_tracked_instances` | gauge | Live instances in the orchestrator's tracker |
| `incuse_desired_runners` | gauge | Most recent target from GitHub |
| `incuse_scaleset_*` | gauge | Mirrors `RunnerScaleSetStatistic` from the listener |
| `incuse_build_info{version,commit}` | gauge | Always 1; for dashboards |

Buckets are tuned for the bimodal job-duration profile (unit tests <2 min, builds hours). If your jobs cluster differently, edit `internal/observability/recorder.go`.

Without an HTTP server, the cheap shell-level check is:

```sh
systemctl is-active incuse
incus list --project incuse >/dev/null
```

Both green → orchestrator is up, the daemon socket works, and we have read access to our project.
